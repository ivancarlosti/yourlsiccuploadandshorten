  * Make a note about it for yourself in the YOURLS database (by default the title field is filled with the original filename and the alteration method)
  * Keep track of views/downloads via YOURLS´s history function
  * Localization support (currently: French, English, Spanish, German and Simplified Chinese. More translations provided by volounteers are greatly appreciated.)

What you need:

  * A webserver with PHP support
  * A functional installation of [YOURLS](http://yourls.org)
  * This Plugin ;-)
  * A bit of understanding what it does and what you can do with it ;-)
