Description
-----------
This plugin lets you upload a file to your webserver and automagically creates a YOURLS short-URL for it. Then you can share that file by its short link as well as its full URL.

Features
--------
  * Different ways to change the filename during the upload
  * Make a note about it for yourself in the YOURLS database (by default the title field is filled with the original filename and the alteration method)
  * Keep track of views/downloads via YOURLS´s history function
  * Localization support (currently: French, English, Spanish, German and Simplified Chinese. More translations provided by volounteers are greatly appreciated.)

Requirements
------------
What you need:

  * A webserver with PHP support
  * A functional installation of [YOURLS](http://yourls.org)
  * This Plugin ;-)
  * A bit of understanding what it does and what you can do with it ;-)
